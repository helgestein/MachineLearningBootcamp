# Machine Learning for Chemistry Bootcamp 2023

Welcome to the Machine Learning for Chemistry Bootcamp 2023, a 4-day online event where we will dive into the world of machine learning and explore various concepts, techniques, and applications. The bootcamp is findable in ILIAS as "5296 – BLOCKVERANSTALTUNG Seminar über Künstliche Intelligenz in der Chemie". 
This repo contains the nessesary code and instructions to participate in the course. The amount of basic code nessesary for this course would have been too much to code as a single person in a really short time so I used a lot of chatGPT to generate some of the basic code in the jupyter notebooks especially for day_1 where we have to download data. Also I found it funny to teach ML with the friendly help of a ML tool.

## Schedule

### Day 1
- Introduction to Machine Learning and Data Exploration
- Basics of unsupervised Learning i.e. Dimensionality Reduction, Clustering and alike

### Day 2
- BAsics of supervised learning i.e. regression using Linear regression and cool things like Random Forests
- Uncertainty and simple metrics

### Day 3
- Advanced Testing and making your models fail in a constructive manner

### Day 4
- Predicting UV-Vis Spectra from Images
- Predicting Melting Points of Molecules
- Early Lifetime Prediction for Batteries

### Bonus Session
- Simple Explainable AI

## Prerequisites

This bootcamp is designed for students with a basic understanding of Python. Participants are expected to have familiarity with data manipulation and visualization.

## Registration

Closed, had been possibile throgh ILIAS

## Materials

Participants will be provided with access to Jupyter notebooks, datasets, and other materials needed for the bootcamp. All materials will be available on GitHub for easy access and collaboration.
