# Machine Learning for Chemistry Bootcamp 2023 :computer: :microscope: :rocket:

Welcome to the *amazing* Machine Learning for Chemistry Bootcamp 2023! :party: This 4-day interactive online seminar is going to blow your mind with all the incredible things you'll learn about machine learning and its applications in chemistry. 💥

This repository is your one-stop-shop for everything you need to participate in the bootcamp, from code to instructions and datasets. 😎 To make your life easier, some of the basic code for day 1 has been generated by the *friendly* chatGPT language model. 😊

So, what can you expect from each day of the bootcamp? Let's take a look! 👀

## Schedule 🗓️

### Day 1: Introduction to Machine Learning and Data Exploration 🤖🔍

We'll start with an introduction to machine learning, followed by an exploration of data using unsupervised learning techniques such as dimensionality reduction and clustering. 📊

### Day 2: Basics of Supervised Learning and Uncertainty 📈🤔

On day 2, we'll cover the basics of supervised learning, including regression using linear regression and cool things like random forests. We'll also explore uncertainty and simple metrics. 🤓

### Day 3: Advanced Testing and Making Your Models Fail Constructively 💥💻

Day 3 will be all about advanced testing and making your models fail in a constructive manner. This is an important skill for any machine learning practitioner, and we'll cover a variety of techniques and best practices. 🏆

### Day 4: Applications of Machine Learning in Chemistry 🔬🤖💡

Finally, on day 4, we'll dive into some *exciting* applications of machine learning in chemistry, including predicting UV-Vis spectra from images, predicting melting points of molecules, and early lifetime prediction for batteries. 🤯

As a bonus, we'll also have a session on simple explainable AI, which will help you understand how your models are making predictions. 🤖💬
